                        Hey there! I'm Samay, a computer science graduate with a mind too fast for my mouth. My interests lie in ideation and creatively solving problems with real world impact. I'm a huge people person; teams and working with people are my preference, though I am very capable of seeing work through from start to finish individually.

                        I was the team lead for this project, for which we used Node.js, AR.js & THREE.js. I ensured agile project delivery through SCRUM and KANBAN practices, achieving and exceeding milestones for all sprints. I leveraged IBM's cloud APIs such as Watson TTS & AI to communicate with users.
